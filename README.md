# Functors and Friends
... is a project for learning purposes.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pawelpanasewicz/FunctorsAndFriends.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pawelpanasewicz/FunctorsAndFriends)

Here I:
- test some snippets from cats and scalaz documentation trying to understand what is going on
- test code presented in tutorials and presentations
- try to solve some problems using Functional Programming
